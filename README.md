# 📰 Financial Market News Sentiment Analysis

Analyse financial news headlines using Python, NLP, and Machine Learning to infer market sentiment.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project scrapes and processes financial news headlines, applies NLP techniques to perform sentiment analysis, and explores how sentiment relates to market trends and investment decisions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans headlines by removing noise, tokenising, and normalising.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Implements models (e.g., RandomForest Classification) to predict the accuracy, F1 Score.
